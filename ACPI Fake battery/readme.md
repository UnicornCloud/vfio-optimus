Muxed or muxless is no longer the obstacle for GPU passthrough on laptops(Not sure this would still be the case for rtx 3000 series). Google “ACPI battery Nvidia gpu laptop passthrough”. And yes I am able to achieve 4800h + rtx 2060 passthrough. Although the cpu memory performance is not so good and I have yet to find a fix for it."
